<h5 id="what-is-vesak-js-">What is Vesak.js?</h5>
<p>Vesak.js is just another date converter that does nothing more than any other date converters. I put the <code>.js</code> to make it sound cool.</p>
<h5 id="why-does-it-exist-then-">Why does it exist then?</h5>
<p>It&#39;s a simple experiment with a client side date conversion to add something to my portfolio. Almost all converters seem to utilize the backend for this causing a slow conversion.</p>
