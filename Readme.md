## What is Vesak?

Vesak.js is just another date converter that does nothing more than any other date converters.

## Why does it exist?
It's a simple experiment with a client side date conversion to add something to my portfolio. Almost all converters seem to utilize the backend for this causing a slow conversion.


## Thanks
I would like to thank the amazing [Prashish Rajbhandari](http://prashishrajbhandari.com.np/) for his extremely useful [libraries](https://github.com/prashishh)
 
## Credits?
Vesak is built using SASS, jQuery, the awesome Sublime 3 text editor powered by lots of tea.
