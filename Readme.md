##### What is Vesak.js?

Vesak.js is just another date converter that does nothing more than any other date converters. I put the `.js` to make it sound cool.

##### Why does it exist then?
It's a simple experiment with a client side date conversion to add something to my portfolio. Almost all converters seem to utilize the backend for this causing a slow conversion.
